# OMML: Error feedback and EF21 for biased compression. Paper's analysis
#### Team: Madina Rinatova, Aleksandra Voronova

It's a repo special for Optimization Methods in Machine Learning [OMML] course.

Here you can find:
* Checkpoints <br>
  Special files to demonstrate that we "do the thing". Files with fragments that in the end will become a part of the final project.
* Jupyter Notebook file
  .ipynb file with a clean version of the paper's analysis: statement, idea, theory, essence of proof, results of experiments.
* Final project
  It's a file that is:
  "<...> 15 minute presentation about the papers **read**. You should present the **problem statement**, the **main ideas** of the authors, perhaps some **comparison** with previous papers, the ***main idea of the proof*** (not necessarily, but a big plus for you), **reproduce** the experiments from the papers and put your own **new** more extensive ones."
  Until told otherwise.
