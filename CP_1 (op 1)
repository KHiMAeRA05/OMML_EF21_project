#Cechpoint #1: Introduction

## Overview:

This project is centered around the development and implementation of communication-efficient optimization techniques tailored for over-parameterized machine learning models. The underlying research is based on the paper titled "Communication-Efficient Optimization for Over-Parameterized Models" authored by [Author Names] and presented at the 35th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2021).

## Problem Statement:

Modern machine learning models, especially those with elaborate architectures and a high number of parameters, face significant challenges during training. These challenges include non-convex optimization, distributed computing, and communication bottlenecks. The primary goal of this project is to address these issues by introducing novel optimization methods that enhance communication efficiency while ensuring convergence in realistic settings.

## Key Objectives:

1. **Optimization of Communication Efficiency**: Implement novel techniques based on biased compression operators to effectively compress and reduce the overhead associated with communication.

2. **Clean Convergence Analysis**: Focus on providing a rigorous convergence analysis that does not rely on restrictive assumptions, such as the bounded gradient assumption.

3. **Practical Implementation**: Translate theoretical advancements from the paper into practical code that can be applied to real-world machine learning tasks.

## Main Contributions of the Paper:

- Development of new and more efficient communication-efficient first-order methods.
- Emphasis on clean convergence analysis without relying on unrealistic assumptions.
- Removal of the need for strong assumptions like the bounded gradient assumption.

## Related Works:

The project is based on the research presented in the paper. It builds upon the existing body of work in optimization for over-parameterized models, aiming to provide more practical and efficient methods.
